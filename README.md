### Huffman
 * takes a text file and compresses it based on the frequency of each character
 * Uses the huffman encoding technique
 * runable from the command line

### Closest pair of points
* takes a list of points and finds the closest two
* there is a naive brute force method that computes using a nested for loop O(n^2)
* also a divide-and-conquer method that splits the list in half O(nlogn)
