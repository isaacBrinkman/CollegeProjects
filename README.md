## CollegeProjects
Some of the projects I've worked on in college.

### Huffman
 * Takes a text file and compresses it based on the frequency of each character
 * Uses the huffman encoding technique
 * Runable from the command line

### Closest pair of points
* Takes a list of points and finds the closest two
* There is a naive brute force method that computes using a nested for loop O(n^2)
* There is also a divide-and-conquer method that splits the list in half O(nlogn)
